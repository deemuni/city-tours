    <h2>Content Inventory Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>What did the client say that they want the web site to accomplish? Describe the goal of the  web site in one or two sentences. (Site Goals)</dt>
            <dd>The goal of the web site is to bring new clients by explaining the products online and giving them option to purchase the products and services of their interest.</dd>
        <dt>Who is the intended audience? Who do you think will use the website? (Basic demographic information)</dt>
            <dd>People who interested in learning and seeing Portland. Visitors and residents are the target market.</dd>
        <dt>What opportunity, problem, or issue did you hear that the client wants to address? (Deeper dive into the site goal)</dt>
            <dd>My client would like to bring in new clients, provide customers with information on their products, services and certain subject, inform customers of news, updates, and calendar events, and sell their product and services online.</dd>
        <dt>What does the client want the site visitors to do? (call(s) to action)</dt>
            <dd>My client would like the site visitors to call them, fill out a contact form, search for information about their tours, and book a tour.</dd>
        <dt>List at least two related or similar sites found on the Web and why you think they are related. What did you like about the websites and what do you think you could improve on for the client's website? (competitive analysis)</dt>
        <dd><a href="http://www.portlandwalkingtours.com">Portland Walking Tours</a> is a company that also offers tours of Portland, but they offer private and small group tours that I think our client should also offer at higher competitive price range.<br><br>
        <a href="http://www.portlandbicycletours.com/tours/">Portland Bicycle Tours</a> is a company that also offers tours of Portland, but instead of walking your bike. My client can see if they can include bicycle option instead of driving option that is mentioned on Growth and Landmarks Tours.</dd>
